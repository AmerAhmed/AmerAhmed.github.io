# Web Development

Firstly, the Wbb development has given me this knowledge of the internet's history, significance, terminology and functionality. Secondly, it gives me the ability to plan, implement, document and evaluate development projects for websites and web applications or other types of applications that build on webkninks.

I have gotten these crafts about the techniques used to build websites and web applications as well as those of these technicians in other software development. I have also acquired these skills of character encoding and ability to handle different standards for character encoding.

I will give me a strong ability to build good web sites and web applications according to standards and guidelines for good practices and with good accessibility for people with different requirements. Knowledge of application architecture, including separation of different logic. I learned about laws and other provisions in the area and ability to make ethical considerations and reflect on privacy issues. It has also given me knowledge of security and ability to identify and counteract attacks.

# Web Development

In this section, I learned how the web as a platform, its history and social impact using technology orientation about the web's protocols, addresses, security and the interaction between client and server. It has given me ideas on how the development process works for a web-based project. Objectives, planning, specification of structure and design, codenin, optimization, testing, documentation and follow-up.

I learned the markup languages and their roles, syntax and semantics, and the main content is the standards for (x) html and CSS3 and DOM and ECmaskcript Character Coding, ASCII, ISO-8859.Windows-1252 and Uncode orientation. .Photos and media with alternative formats, optimization and accessibility. National and international guidelines for good practice in web development. Achieving interoperability by following state hosts and testing on different user agents.

Applications that work independently of user agent, operating system or hardware platform selection, and accessibility accessibility based on applications being understandable, useful, intelligible and robust for disabled users. Quality assurance of application functionality and validation of code quality. Laws and other regulations governing digital, such as the perosinformation Act and the Electronic Communications Act. Terminology in the field of web development and design.
