# Hello there!

My name is Amer Ahmed and like to make websites. I've been blogging for a long time but was curious about how I could build a blog myself. How difficult could it really be? How much did I have to learn? Right now I'm sitting here and creating codes while watching the blog grow. It is an exciting challenge and not at all as difficult as I first thought. I feel so proud and I like being social online. My dream is to become a web development and programmer in the future, so called full stack developer
This is the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as

## Developments

I come from Varnamo, but next month will move to Kalmar to study web programmers at Linnaeus University and will live there. I attended high school in Varnamo with a specialization in technology and I have github account and there is project that has been done, when I was in high school. It is open source software think it is an good idea to study here in Kalmar because there are more fantastic opportunities that can get and move forward. It's great to work on creating something new and Linnaeus University has both education and teachers are good. It's great here so I can learn everything as soon as possible. As the teacher is close and helpful as well as skilled.

## Conclusion

Firstly, Web development has given me this knowledge of the Internet's history, significance, terminology and functionality. Secondly,
it gives me the ability to plan, implement, document and evaluate development projects for websites and web applications or other types of applications based on web technology. Web development is an important topic for all types of media on the Internet and it gives us a good reason for anyone who wants to work with web portals and basically handle everything from style templates HTML5 and CSS3 to JavaScript. I have received these crafts on the techniques used to build websites and web applications as well as those of these other software development techniques. I have also acquired these character encoding skills and the ability to handle different character encoding standards.
